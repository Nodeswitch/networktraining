## Overview

## Background

Recent thinking conceptulises mental wellbeing as comprising of environmental, psychological and social factors, a challenge to static factor models. Psychologists wishing to study the dynamic interaction of many factors may wish to consider a complexity science perspective such as network analysis.



## What is a network?

A network is a set of nodes connected by a set of edges. A network (as collection of various nodes and edges) can be defined as a graph

Several packages are used in the network analysis, including `network`, `statnet`, `igraph` and `qgraph`.

qgraph was developed in the context of psychometrics approach by Dr. Sacha Epskamp and colleagues in 2012. We will be be working with `qgraph`.
