\chapter*{Overview}\label{overview}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Overview}

Materials for the 2.5 day Network Analysis course.

This course covers skills such as installing R, opening fies, data
wrangling with tidyverse, and data visualisation with ggplot2. It also
introduces network analysis as a statistical concept.

\chapter{Starting with R}\label{starting-with-r}

{Welcome to the Course!}

\section{Overview}\label{overview-1}

Installing R and opening files

\textbf{In this session you will learn:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is R?
\item
  How to install R
\item
  How to open files.
\item
  How to maniuplate data and save scripts.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What is R?}\label{what-is-r}

For network analysis, you need two different bits of software, R and
RStudio. R is a programming language that you will write code in and R
Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which makes
working with R easier.

\subsection{Base R}\label{base-r}

Install base R from \url{https://cran.rstudio.com/}. Choose the download
link for your operating system (Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows).

\subsection{R Studio}\label{r-studio}

Go to \url{https://rstudio.com} and download the RStudio Desktop (Open
Source License) version for your operating system under the list titled
\textbf{Installers for Supported Platforms.}

\subsection{Advantages of using R}\label{advantages-of-using-r}

{Quickfire Questions}

We have put questions throughout to help you test your knowledge. When
you type in or choose the correct answer, the dashed box will change
color and become solid green.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  From the following options, how do you get R on your machine?
  Installing Base R \& R Studio Installing R Studio Installing Base R
\end{itemize}

Explain This Answer!

R is the basic package. R Studio is an add-on that make R much easier to
use.

\chapter{Working With Data in R}\label{working-with-data-in-r}

\section{Overview}\label{overview-2}

This is the most basic introduction to R. The material is based on the
data skills course for MSc students. Find lots and lots of useful
resources here:
\url{https://gupsych.github.io/data_skills/01_intro.html} Please take a
look at these resources in your own time.

\subsection{Setting Working Directory}\label{setting-working-directory}

First things first, we have to set our Working Directory to the place
our file is. In RStudio we do this by hitting `Session \textgreater{}
Set Working Directory \textgreater{} Source File Location'. This lets us
interact with other files that are outside of our current script (and
keeps our project nice and tidy).

\subsection{Code}\label{code}

RStudio generally has four panels: Current file, Console, Environment,
and Viewer. You can think of the console as a place to try things out,
and the file to write down ideas you want to stick around. Go to the
console and type

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{5}
\NormalTok{x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Notice how now the environment shows we have a Value x that is 6. We
have just created a variable. In the above, we would say ``the variable
x is assigned to 1 + 5'' or ``x gets 1 + 5''

\chapter{Network Analysis}\label{network-analysis}

\section{Overview}\label{overview-3}

\section{Background}\label{background}

Recent thinking conceptulises mental wellbeing as comprising of
environmental, psychological and social factors. Psychologists wishing
to study all of these factors together may wish to consider a complexity
science perspective such as network analysis.

\section{What is a network?}\label{what-is-a-network}

A network is a set of nodes connected by a set of edges.

Several packages are used in the network analysis, including
\texttt{network}, \texttt{statnet}, \texttt{igraph} and \texttt{qgraph}.

qgraph was developed in the context of psychometrics approach by
Dr.~Sacha Epskamp and colleagues in 2012. We will be be working with
\texttt{qgraph}.

\chapter{Practical}\label{practical}

\section{Description of Data}\label{description-of-data}

We will work with a local dataset gathered from high school age
children.
