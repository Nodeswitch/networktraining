How to install R How to open files. How to maniuplate data and save scripts. 1.1.1 What is R? For network analysis, you need two different bits of software, R and RStudio. R is a programming language that you will write code in and R Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which makes working with R easier. 1.1.2 How To Install Base R Install base R from https://cran.rstudio.com/. Choose the download link for your operating system (Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows). 1.1.3 How To Install R Studio Go to https://rstudio.com and download the RStudio Desktop (Open Source License) version for your operating system under the list titled Installers for Supported Platforms. 1.1.4 Quiz Quickfire Questions We have put questions throughout to help you test your knowledge. When you type in or choose the correct answer, the dashed box will change color and become solid green. From the following options, how do you get R on your machine? Installing Base R &amp; R Studio Installing R Studio Installing Base R Explain This Answer! R is the basic package. R Studio is an add-on that make R much easier to use. "],
["working-with-data-in-r.html", "Session 2 Working With Data in R 2.1 Overview", " Session 2 Working With Data in R 2.1 Overview This is a basic introduction to R. The material is based on the data skills course for MSc students. Find lots and lots of useful resources here: https://gupsych.github.io/data_skills/01_intro.html Please take a look at these resources in your own time. 2.1.1 Setting Working Directory First things first, we will set the working directory. What this means is that we need to tell R where the files we need are located. Think of it just like when you have different projects, and you have seperate folders for each project e.g. research conducted in schools, research conducted in the community and so on. When working on R, it's useful to have all the data sets and files you need in one folder. To set the working directory press session -&gt; set working directory -&gt; choose directory and then select the folder where the data sets we are working on are saved, and save this file in the same folder as well. In other words- make sure your data sets and scripts are all in the same folder. 2.1.2 Code RStudio generally has four panels: Current file, Console, Environment, and Viewer. You can think of the console as a place to try things out, and the file to write down ideas you want to stick around. Go to the console and type x &lt;- 1 + 5 x Notice how now the environment shows we have a Value x that is 6. We have just created a variable. In the above, we would say “the variable x is assigned to 1 + 5” or “x gets 1 + 5” "],

Psychologists wishing to study all of these factors together may wish to consider a complexity science perspective such as network analysis. 3.3 What is a network? A network is a set of nodes connected by a set of edges. Several packages are used in the network analysis, including network, statnet, igraph and qgraph. qgraph was developed in the context of psychometrics approach by Dr. Sacha Epskamp and colleagues in 2012. We will be be working with qgraph. "],
