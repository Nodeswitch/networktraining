Please download the .csv file HERE library(tidyverse) data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;networkdataset.csv&quot;) 4.2 Visualising Data How many females and males? The # symbol in the code is a comment. Comments do not add anything to the code but are there for human understanding to explain what is happening in the code. Look at the comments in the code below to understand what is going on. # we are telling R we want to plot dat, we are letting R know Gender # is a factor on our x axis and we want to fill with colour ggplot(data, aes(x = as.factor(Gender), fill = as.factor(Gender))) + # we are choosing a bar plot geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE, alpha = .8) + # we are naming the x scale scale_x_discrete(name = &quot;Gender&quot;) + # we are chosing a colour scheme from pre-exising options scale_fill_viridis_d(option = &quot;D&quot;) + # we are naming the y scale scale_y_continuous(name = &quot;Number of participants&quot;)+ # we are chosing a theme from pre-existing options theme_minimal() Figure 4.1: Participant Gender Are there more males or females? 4.3 Working With Data Participants rated themselves on 23 items of the TEQ questionnaire. We would like to create a plot to visualise the total TEQ and where participants live. However, we need to clean the data a little bit first. We will explain each line. The pipe operator %&gt;% means &quot;and then&quot; we create a new dataframe called total_TEQ which we assign to our new code we then use select, the . lets R know we are still working with the same dataframe. We then select all TEQ variables, Pcode and Place select(., TEQ1:TEQ23, Pcode, Place gather tranforms the data from wide to long. We only want it to do this to TEQ variables so we -Pcode and -Place We then use group_by(Pcode, Place) as we want to look at scores for each participant and where they live Finally summarise(tot_TEQ = sum(score)) creates a column named tot_TEQ which has the total TEQ score for each participant. total_TEQ &lt;- data %&gt;% select(., TEQ1:TEQ23, Pcode, Place) %&gt;% gather(&quot;var&quot;, &quot;score&quot;, -Pcode, -Place) %&gt;% group_by(Pcode, Place) %&gt;% summarise(tot_TEQ = sum(score)) ggplot(total_TEQ, aes(x = as.factor(Place), fill = as.factor(Place), y = tot_TEQ)) + geom_violin(show.legend = FALSE, trim = TRUE, draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) + geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.1, show.legend = FALSE) + scale_y_continuous(name = &quot;Total TEQ&quot;) + scale_x_discrete(name = &quot;Place&quot;) Figure 4.2: TEQ Scores What location tends to have highest TEQ?
