# Working With Data in R

## Overview

This is a basic introduction to R. The material is based on the data skills course for MSc students. Find lots and lots of useful resources here: https://gupsych.github.io/data_skills/01_intro.html Please take a look at these resources in your own time.

### Setting Working Directory

First things first, we will set the working directory. What this means is that we need to tell R where the files we need are located. Think of it just like when you have different projects, and you have seperate folders for each project e.g. research conducted in schools, research conducted in the community and so on. When working on R, it's useful to have all the data sets and files you need in one folder.

To set the working directory press session -> set working directory -> choose directory and then select the folder where the data sets we are working on are saved, and save this file in the same folder as well. In other words- make sure your data sets and scripts are all in the same folder.

### Code

RStudio generally has four panels: Current file, Console, Environment, and Viewer. You can think of the console as a place to try things out, and the file to write down ideas you want to stick around. Go to the console and type


```r
x <- 1 + 5
x
```

Notice how now the environment shows we have a Value x that is 6. We have just created a variable. In the above, we would say “the variable x is assigned to 1 + 5” or “x gets 1 + 5”
